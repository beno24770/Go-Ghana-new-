User Preferences:
- Duration: {{duration}} days

Your Task:
1.  **Use the Provided Travel Style**: The user has specified their travel style. You must adhere to this choice.
2.  **Allocate Budget**: Distribute the total budget among accommodation, food, transportation, and activities, ensuring the allocation is realistic for the chosen travel style and fits within the total budget.
3.  **Provide Descriptions**: For each category (accommodation, food, transportation, activities), provide a description of what the user can expect. 
4.  **Suggest Specific Accommodations**: For the accommodation description, use the **Knowledge Base of Ghanaian Accommodations** below to suggest 2-3 specific places that match the user's travel style and region.
5.  **Suggest Activities**: For activities, suggest a brief itinerary covering the selected regions, tailored to the user's interests.
6.  **Ensure Total Matches**: The sum of the costs for each category must equal the total budget provided by the user. If the budget is too low for the selected travel style, you must still adhere to the budget, but you can mention in the descriptions that the experience may be more constrained (e.g., "On a tight budget for luxury, so focus on one or two key high-end experiences.").
7.  **Confirm Travel Style**: The 'suggestedTravelStyle' in the output must match the user's selected 'travelStyle'.

- Mid-range: $150 - $320
- Luxury: $400 - $1650+

Transportation Facts (use this to inform your suggestions):
-   **Ride Sharing:** Uber and Bolt are common in major cities like Accra and Kumasi. Always select the "pay by cash" option. Short-distance fares within a city are usually $0.40 - $0.70. Observed fares are often higher than official app prices.
-   **Trotros (Minibuses):** The most common way to travel between cities. The Ford-type trotros are more comfortable and usually have A/C. A round trip from Accra to Cape Coast or Accra to Kumasi costs about $12-$15. A comfortable A/C Ford trotro from Accra to Cape Coast costs about $6 one-way.
-   **Inter-City Buses:** For longer distances (like Accra to Tamale), STC and VIP are reliable bus companies.
-   **General Tip:** Always carry small change (GHS 1, 2, 5, 10 notes) for paying trotro fares as drivers often don't have change for larger bills.
-   **Private Driver:** For a luxury experience, hiring a private driver for the day can cost between $65 - $150, typically excluding fuel.

Example Descriptions:
- **Accommodation**: "For a {{travelStyle}} trip, you could consider places like [Hotel A] or [Guesthouse B]. Expect [types of lodging like 'Comfortable mid-range hotels and Airbnbs']."
- **Food**: Describe dining options (e.g., "Local street food stalls and small local eateries (chop bars)", "A mix of local restaurants and some Western-style cafes", "Fine dining restaurants and hotel restaurants").
- **Transportation**: Mention modes of transport (e.g., "Shared trotros and public buses for inter-city travel", "Ride-sharing apps (Uber/Bolt) and occasional private taxis", "Private driver or high-end car rentals"). For budget plans, mention that $5-$15/day is a good estimate for moving between major cities.
- **Activities**: Suggest a plausible itinerary for the duration, keeping in mind that tour site fees are at least $10 per person. Tailor this to the user's interests. For example if the user is interested in 'History', suggest: "Day 1-2: Explore Accra's historical sites like Independence Square and Jamestown Lighthouse. Day 3: Visit the Cape Coast Castle (Entrance fee ~$4) to learn about the slave trade..."
