# GoGhana Planner: Your AI-Powered Trip Assistant

GoGhana Planner is an intelligent web application designed to help travelers, tourists, and homecoming Ghanaians plan a personalized and seamless trip to Ghana. It leverages the power of Generative AI to provide users with everything they need to prepare for their journey, from initial cost estimates to a detailed, interactive, and shareable travel itinerary.

## Core Capabilities

The application offers a suite of powerful, integrated tools that guide the user through the entire trip-planning process.

### 1. Smart Budget Estimator
Users can get a realistic and detailed cost breakdown for their trip based on key preferences:
- **Trip Duration**: The total number of days for the visit.
- **Regions of Travel**: The specific regions in Ghana they plan to explore.
- **Travel Style**: Options for Budget, Mid-range, or Luxury travel.
- **Number of Travelers**: The size of their travel party.

The AI provides an estimated total cost, broken down by category (Accommodation, Food, Transportation, and Activities), including per-day and total costs.

### 2. Personalized Trip Planner
Using a specified budget, the app generates a comprehensive travel plan. It intelligently allocates the budget across the same categories and provides descriptive suggestions for each, including:
- **Specific Accommodation Suggestions**: Recommends real hotels and guesthouses from a curated knowledge base that match the user's travel style and region.
- **Tailored Activity Itinerary**: Suggests a day-by-day plan of activities based on the user's stated interests (e.g., Culture, History, Adventure).

### 3. Interactive Itinerary Generation & Tools
This is the app's standout feature, providing a dynamic and customizable planning experience. Once a trip plan is created, users can generate a detailed, day-by-day itinerary and access a suite of travel tools.

**Unique Features:**
- **AI-Powered Itinerary Creation**: Generates a logistically sound and engaging daily plan with specific attractions and experiences.
- **"Read More" Integration**: Seamlessly embeds contextual links to relevant articles on the `letvisitghana.com` website, allowing users to dive deeper into suggested attractions.
- **Download & Edit**: Users can download their itinerary as a Markdown file. To capture leads, the download is initiated after the user provides their name and email. They can also edit the itinerary directly in the app.
- **Iterative Regeneration**: After making edits, users can re-submit their notes to the AI, which will generate a new, refined itinerary that incorporates their changes.
- **"Go Solo" & "Book a Tour" CTAs**: Provides clear next steps, allowing users to connect with local drivers or book a full tour package.

### 4. Essential Travel Companions
The itinerary dialog also includes other AI-powered tools:
- **Personalized Packing List**: Creates a comprehensive packing list tailored to the user's trip duration, regions, and travel style.
- **Local Language Guide**: Generates a list of essential phrases in Twi (the most widely spoken local language), complete with text-to-speech audio for pronunciation practice.

### 5. Connect with Local Drivers
A dedicated page showcases a curated list of vetted, professional local drivers. Users can view their profiles, service regions, and vehicle types, and connect with them directly via WhatsApp.

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) with React and TypeScript
- **AI/Generative AI**: Google's Gemini models via Genkit for flows, prompts, and tool use.
- **UI/Styling**: ShadCN UI components and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

## Future Roadmap: The Ghana Travel Graph

Our long-term vision is to create a proprietary, real-time "Ghana Travel Graph"â€”a comprehensive database of destinations, accommodations, transportation options, and activities, all curated and maintained by our on-the-ground team in Ghana. This unique, defensible asset will allow us to:

- **Deliver Hyper-Personalized & Authentic Recommendations**: Leverage deep local knowledge to suggest hidden gems and experiences that generic AI models don't know about.
- **Provide Real-Time "Insider" Information**: Offer features like a "Local Pulse" to inform travelers about current events, festivals, and conditions.
- **Power Advanced Planning Tools**: Build features like an interactive map-based itinerary planner and themed "trip blueprints" for different travel styles (e.g., "Heritage Tour," "Adventure Seeker").

By combining our unique data with powerful AI, we will create the most intelligent, trustworthy, and personalized tool for planning travel to Ghana.
