# GoGhana Planner: Your Hybrid Intelligence Trip Assistant

In today's world, anyone can ask a generic AI to "plan a trip to Ghana." But the results are often a mix of clichés, outdated information, and hallucinated recommendations. For a trip as important as one to Ghana, travelers deserve more than just a guess—they need a guide they can trust.

**GoGhana Planner** is built on a different philosophy. We believe the future of travel planning isn't just about AI; it's about **Hybrid Intelligence**. We've combined the powerful reasoning of Google's Gemini models with a proprietary knowledge base of high-quality, curated, and vetted data from on-the-ground experts in Ghana.

This means you get the speed and personalization of AI, with the trust and authenticity that only comes from real, local expertise.

## Our Core Differentiator: AI + Curated Data

- **Generic AI Planners**: Rely on scraping the public internet, leading to generic, unreliable, and often incorrect suggestions. They don't know the best local "chop bar" from a tourist trap.
- **GoGhana Planner**: Operates from a foundation of truth. Our AI is guided by our own datasets, including:
    - **The Local Pulse**: A proprietary feed of festivals, cultural events, and nightlife with real dates and insider tips.
    - **Vetted Accommodations & Drivers**: Hand-picked lists of trusted hotels and professional drivers for every budget and style.
    - **Real-World Logistics**: Practical knowledge of travel times, costs, and local conditions that a generic model can't comprehend.
